	A long time ago, powerful flesh mages created the ultimate servants for themselves: Angels. \
	They designed them to be beautiful, to have wings and the power of flight for speedy transportation, \
	and most importantly to be incredibly supernaturally empathic. These beings would feel the wants, \
	needs, pains and dislikes of those around them more keenly than their own. If you wanted a message \
	delivered, they wanted to deliver it. They were the perfect servants, however eventually the secret \
	to creating them was lost and over time they died out.<br><br>\
	Their descendants today are referred to as aasimir, none today still have wings or any remnants \
	of them, but many like heights and dream of flying. They are also more attractive than most people \
	and tend to live a little longer. Most importantly they still have some degree of the Angelic empathy, \
	while not nearly as strong, they still naturally want the same things as those around them. \
	It works like a sort of unspoken peer pressure, and draws them naturally to jobs and lifestyles \
	that are more selfless or service oriented. It's common to find them working in charities or as \
	aid workers, or even as masseuse or prostitutes.<br><br>\
